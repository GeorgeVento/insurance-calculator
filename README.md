## Insurance Premium Calculator

This project is a simple web application written entirely in PHP designed to calculate insurance costs and apply discount codes. All logic, form handling, and presentation are contained within a single file, making it highly portable for local development environments.

## 🛠️ Technologies

PHP: All elements—the presentation (form), the data handling, and the calculation logic—are contained within a single file.

HTML/CSS: Used for the structure and basic styling of the user interface.

## 📦 Content

INSURANCE_FORM.php: The core application file, which handles session management, calculation, and form display.

## 🧮 Functionality

The application provides the following core features:

Insurance Selection: Users can select multiple insurance types, each with a predetermined cost (Health: €100, Car: €150, Home: €200, Life: €300).

Total Calculation: Calculates the sum of the selected insurance premiums.

Discount Code Entry: Allows the user to enter a discount code.

Discount Application: Validates the code and applies the corresponding percentage discount (10%, 20%, or 30%) to the total premium, showing the final amount.
